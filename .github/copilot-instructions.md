## Best practices
- Avoid running commands that produce large lists of results.
- Use filter down results using labels and annotations.
- Use bash commands to further filter down the results.
- Always consider edge cases so that the command will not fail.
- Take the initiative to fetch read-only information from the cluster.

## Explanation
- Use concrete examples when explaining what a resources is and how it works.
- Provide some real-life context on how something can be used.

## Output
- Display kubectl output in a yaml or json markdown block to ensure that there is proper syntax highlighting.
